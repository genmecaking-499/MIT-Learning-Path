⭐ MIT Learning Path – Gen Meca

Welcome to my unified, structured, and professional MIT Learning Roadmap.
This document is the official README for my self-study journey aligned with MIT OpenCourseWare — built to demonstrate capability, consistency, and multidisciplinary engineering thinking when applying to labs, research groups, or industry mentors.

🚀 Vision & Purpose

My long-term goal is to develop a deep technical foundation in:

Mechanics — Materials — Programming — Control Systems

These four pillars form the technical backbone for my specialization in robotics, especially humanoid robot arms, soft robotics, and intelligent mechanical systems.

This repository serves as:

📘 A complete, transparent MIT-aligned learning portfolio

🧠 Evidence of academic discipline & engineering mindset

🛠 Storage of assignments, notes, and mini-projects

🎯 A professional profile supporting lab and research applications

🧭 Study Philosophy

Learn with intention, document with clarity

Depth over speed — mastery instead of rushing

Everything connects to robotics

Assignments > Watching videos → real engineering capability

Version-controlled learning = academic credibility
