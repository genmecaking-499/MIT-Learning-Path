# MIT Learning Path – Gen Meca

Welcome to my unified, structured, and professional MIT Learning Roadmap.
This document is the **official README** for my self-study journey aligned with MIT OpenCourseWare — designed to present my capability, consistency, and multidisciplinary approach when applying to labs, research groups, or industry mentors.

---

# 🚀 Vision & Purpose

I aim to build a deep foundation across **Mechanics**, **Materials**, **Programming**, and **Control Systems** — forming the backbone for my long-term robotics specialization.

This repository serves as:

* 📘 A complete learning portfolio following MIT standards
* 🧠 Evidence of academic discipline & engineering thinking
* 🛠 A place to store assignments, notes, and mini‑projects
* 🎯 A professional profile for lab applications (HCMUT & international)

# 🧭 Study Philosophy

* **Learn with intention, document with clarity**
* **Prioritize depth over speed**
* **Every concept must connect to robotics**
* **Assignments > videos** (proof of real capability)
* **Version‑controlled learning** → better credibility

# 📂 How This Repo Works

Each course folder will contain:

* `Notes/` – summary of theory
* `Assignments/` – problem sets + my solutions
* `Projects/` – simulations, code, CAD, or reports
* `Resources/` – references, diagrams, formulas
* `README.md` per course – progress & insights

This organization mirrors MIT’s real course structure.

# 🔧 Tools & Workflow

* **GitHub** → tracking and versioning
* **VS Code** → note‑taking + coding
* **Markdown** → documentation
* **Python / MATLAB** → computations
* **CAD tools** → Mechanics + Materials
* **Control simulations** → Python, MATLAB, Simulink
